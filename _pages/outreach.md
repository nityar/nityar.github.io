    content: <h1>APS Conference for Undergraduate Women and Gender Minorities in Physics (CU*iP)</h1><br>
            I am a member of the program committee for the <a href="https://www.aps.org/initiatives/inclusion/gender-inclusive/undergraduate-women-minorities">2026 APS CU*iP</a> which will be held in Denver this March. CU\*iP is an annual national professional conference which aims to connect undergraduate physics majors with peers and mentors with shared experiences.
            # I'll be leading a parallel session entitled How to Give Good Presentations. Materials from this session will be available after the conference and are adapted from [Professor Kelly Douglass](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/pas/people/faculty/douglass-kelly/index.html)'s _The Art of Presenting_ workshop series.
