## APS Conference for Undergraduate Women and Gender Minorities in Physics (CU\*iP)
I am a member of the program committee for the [2026 APS CU\*iP](https://www.aps.org/initiatives/inclusion/gender-inclusive/undergraduate-women-minorities) which will be held in Denver this March. CU\*iP is an annual national professional conference which aims to connect undergraduate physics majors with peers and mentors with shared experiences.<!--I'll be leading a parallel session entitled How to Give Good Presentations. Materials from this session will be available after the conference and are adapted from [Professor Kelly Douglass](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/pas/people/faculty/douglass-kelly/index.html)'s _The Art of Presenting_ workshop series. -->

## Astronomy on Tap Rochester
Come listen to public astronomy talks by local astronomy undergraduate and graduate students, professors, and amateur astronomers! The Rochester chapter has events one Tuesday per month at [MicGinny's on the River](https://www.micginnys.com/). I help with promotion for AoT Rochester and gave a talk last October about counter-rotating spiral galaxies: _Some Galaxies Spin Weird!_ For details on the next event, you can check out the AoT Rochester [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/aotrochester) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aotrochester) page.

The University of Rochester's [C.E.K. Mees Observatory](https://www.pas.rochester.edu/about/observatory.html) in Naples, NY is used primarily for teaching at outreach. I lead a few public tours of the observatory every summer. Tours are free and available from June through August. You can make a reservation [here](https://webapps.pas.rochester.edu/mees/).
