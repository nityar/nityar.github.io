I am a fourth-year Physics & Astronomy Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Rochester and a member of the [DESI collaboration](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/). I also serve on the physics depeartment's graduate student association board. I received a B.S. in Astrophysics and Applied Mathematics from UCLA in 2022.

My research focuses on studying galaxy kinematics and dark matter in galaxies using large-scale galaxy surveys. When I'm not thinking about the weird ways in which galaxies spin, I like to watch football (go 49ers!) and movies, run, and sew.
