The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) is the relationship between rotational velocity and baryonic mass in spiral galaxies. Since a galaxy's rotational velocity is due to its dynamical mass which consits of both its baryonic mass and dark matter, the BTFR can be used to study dark matter in galaxies. In my paper[_The Extended Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation for SDSS MaNGA Galaxies_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18577), I developed a way to include non-rotating elliptical galaxies in the relation to study the BTFR at the high mass end. My analysis revealed that we need observations of the faintest galaxies in the nearby universe to differentiate between different dark matter models.
You can check out my [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18577) on this subject or my [AAS iPoster](https://aas242-aas.ipostersessions.com/?s=06-5A-F0-5B-84-23-D2-EA-D7-37-E7-EE-E9-0E-FB-61).

## Counter-Rotating Spiral Galaxies

The main baryonic mass components of spiral galaxies are stars and gas. In most spiral galaxies, these two components rotate toghether in a disk, but in some spiral galaxies, the gas and stelalr disk are offset from each other. In some cases, the two components are rotating in completely opposite directions! What causes this odd kinematic feature is still unknown; I am interested in disentangling environmental causes and internal causes. <!--The above graphic was created by my REU student Emilio Benitez Aguinaga.-->
