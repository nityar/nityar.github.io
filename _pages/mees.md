### C.E.K. Mees Observatory

The University of Rochester's [C.E.K. Mees Observatory](https://www.pas.rochester.edu/about/observatory.html) in Naples, NY is used primarily for teaching at outreach. I lead a few public tours of the observatory every summer. Tours are free and available from June through August. You can make a reservation [here](https://webapps.pas.rochester.edu/mees/).
